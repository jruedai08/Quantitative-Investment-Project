This project is based on Liu et al (2024) "Replicating and Digesting Anomalies in the Chinese A-Share Market" and Ao et al (2019) "Approaching Mean-Variance Efficiency for Large  Portfolios". 
The code consists 6 parts. 
(1) data process
(2) anomalies construction: In this part we construct 27 anomalies based on 8 classes of chrarcters.
(3) indicator calculation: In this part we calculate some essential indicator including annual return, annual volatility and Maximum drawdown etc.
(4) indiactor calculation part â…¡ & anomalies selection
(5) MAXSER: replicate the estimator "Approaching Mean-Variance Efficiency for Large  Portfolios"
(6) alpha: calculate the abnormal return from CH-3 factor model and CH-4 factor model in Liu et al (2019) "Size and value in China".
